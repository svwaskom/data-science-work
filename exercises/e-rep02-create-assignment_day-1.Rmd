*Purpose*: In this class you'll turn in all your work using GitHub. To do this, you'll need to create a repository. This short exercise will walk you through doing this.

*Reading*: Follow all the steps in [Creating a Repository](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/03-create/index.html). *Hint*: You can `Ctrl + Click` (`CMD + Click`) to follow links in RStudio.

*Note*: For the steps in the reading, I recommend using the Terminal in RStudio. This should help ensure you have access to Git.

*Topics*: Creating a GitHub repository

# Set Up Your Repository
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

- Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/) and click the "New" button to start creating a new repository.

- Give your a repository a name (such as `data-science-work`), enable "Initialize this repository with a README", then click "Create repository". This will take you to your new repository.

*Important Note*: Make sure to click "Initialize this repository with a README"! This will help when you go to clone your repository later!

Next, follow the steps in [e-rep01-intro-git](https://github.com/zdelrosario/data-science-curriculum/blob/master/exercises/e-rep01-intro-git.md) to clone your new repository (make sure to target your new repository, though!).

*Finishing*: When you complete this exercise, [fill out this survey](https://forms.gle/Cvr8tUt3hRoLFb4C7) with your new repo url.
