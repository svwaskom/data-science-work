*Purpose*: When first studying a new dataset, there are very simple checks we
should perform first. These are those checks.

*Reading*: (None)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# knitr options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

__q0__ Run the following chunk:

*Hint*: You can do this either by clicking the green arrow at the top-right of
the chunk, or by using the keybaord shortcut `Shift` + `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Enter`.

```{r }
head(iris)
```

This is a *dataset*; the fundamental object we'll study throughout this course.
Some nomenclature:

- The `1, 2, 3, ...` on the left enumerate the **rows** of the dataset
- The names `Sepal.Length`, `Sepal.Width`, `...` name the **columns** of the dataset
- The column `Sepal.Length` takes **numeric** values
- The column `Species` takes **string** values

__q1__ Load the `tidyverse` and inspect the `diamonds` dataset. What do the
`cut`, `color`, and `clarity` variables mean?

*Hint*: You can run `?diamonds` to get information on a built-in dataset.

```{r load-packages}
library(tidyverse)
?diamonds
```
<!-- answer-begin -->
the variables mean:
  
  - `cut`: quality of the cut (`Fair`, `Good`, `Very Good`, `Premium`, `Ideal`)
  - `color`: diamond color, from `D` (best) to `J` (worst)
  - `clarity`: a measurement of how clear the diamond is(`l1` (worst), `Sl2`, `Sl1`, `VS2`, `VS1`, `VVS2`, `VVS1`, `lF` (best))
<!-- answer-end -->

__q2__ Run `glimpse(diamonds)`; what variables does `diamonds` have?

```{r}
glimpse(diamonds)
```
<!-- answer-begin -->
`diamonds` has variables `carat`, `cut`, `color`, `clarity`, `depth`, `table`, `price`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.
<!-- answer-end -->

__q3__ Run `summary(diamonds)`; what are the common values for each of the
variables? How widely do each of the variables vary?

*Hint*: The `Median` and `Mean` are common values, while `Min` and `Max` give us
a sense of variation.

```{r summary}
summary(diamonds)
```

**Observations**:

- `carat` ranges from 0.2 to 5.01, but is mostly around 0.7 -  0.8
- `cut`, `color`, and `clarity` are specific allowed values, with the most common `cut` being `Ideal`, most common `color` being `G`, and most common `clarity` being `SI1`
- `depth` averages around 61
- `table` averages around 57
- `price` ranges from 326 to 18,823

You should always analyze your dataset in the simplest way possible, build
hypotheses, and devise more specific analyses to probe those hypotheses. The
`glimpse()` and `summary()` functions are two of the simplest tools we have.
