*Purpose*: Your ability to get stuff done is highly dependent on your
fluency with your tools. One aspect of fluency is knowing and *using*
keyboard shortcuts. In this exercise, we’ll go over some of the most
important ones.

*Reading*: [Keyboard
shortcuts](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts);
[Code Chunk Options](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html)
*Note*: Use this reading to look up answers to the questions below.
Rather than *memorizing* this information, I recommend you download a
[cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf),
and either print it out or save it in a convenient place on your
computer. Get used to referencing your cheatsheets while doing data
science—practice makes perfect\!

**q1** What do the following keyboard shortcuts do?

  - Within the script editor or a chunk
    
      - `Alt` + `-`
        
        Inserts `<-`
    
      - `Shift` + `Cmd/Ctrl` + `M`
        
        Inserts `%<%`
    
      - `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Enter`
        
        Runs current line or selection
    
      - `F1` (Note: on a Mac you need to press `fn` + `F1`)
        
        Shows help for the function

  - Within R Markdown
    
      - `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Alt` + `I`
        
        Inserts a (code) chunk

  - Within a chunk
    
      - `Shift` + `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Enter`
        
        Runs the chunk

**q2** For a chunk, what header option do you use to

  - Run the code, don’t display it, but show its results?

  - Run the code, but don’t display it or its results?

**q3** How do stop the code in a chunk from running once it has started?
