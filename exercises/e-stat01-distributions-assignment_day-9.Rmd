*Purpose*: We will use *distributions* to model and understand data. To that end, we'll need to understand some key ideas about distributions. Namely, we'll discuss *random variables*, how we model random variables with distributions, and the importance of *random seeds*. We're not going to learn everything we need to work with data in this single exercise, but this will be our starting point.

*Reading*: (None; this exercise *is* the reading.)

## Distributions
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Fundamentally, a distribution (also known as a density) is a *function*: It takes an input, and returns an output. A distribution has a special interpretation though; it represents the *relative likelihood* of particular values occuring.

First, let's look at a distribution of some real data:

```{r ex-mpg}
mpg %>%
  filter(class == "midsize") %>%
  ggplot(aes(cty, color = class)) +
  geom_density()
```

This density indicates that a value around `18` is more prevalent than other values of `cty`, at least for `midsize` vehicles in this dataset. Note that the plot above took a set of `cty` values, and smoothed them to create a density.

Next, let's look at a normal distribution:

```{r ex-distribution}
## NOTE: No need to change this!
df_norm_dist <-
  tibble(z = seq(-5, +5, length.out = 100)) %>%
  mutate(d = dnorm(z, mean = 0, sd = 1))

df_norm_dist %>%
  ggplot(aes(z, d)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    y = "density"
  )
```

This plot of the *density* of a normal distribution shows that the value `z = 0` is most likely, while values both larger and smaller are less likely to occur. Note that the the density above was generated by `dnorm(z, mean = 0, sd = 1)`. The values `[mean, sd]` are called *parameters*. Rather than requiring an entire dataset to define this distribution, the normal is fully defined by specifying values for `mean` and `sd`.

However, note that the normal distribution is quite a bit simpler than the distribution of `cty` values above. This is a general trend; named distributions like the normal are simplified models we use to represent real data. Picking an appropriate model is part of the challenge in statistics.

`R` comes with a great many distributions implemented:

| Distribution | Code |
|---|---|
| Normal | `norm` |
| Uniform | `unif` |
| Chi-squared | `chisq` |
| ... | ... |

In `R` we access a distribution by prefixing its name with the letter `d`.

__q1__ Modify the code below to evaluate a uniform distribution with `min = -1` and `max = +1`. Assign this value to `d`.

```{r q1-task}
## TODO: Complete this code
# df_q1 <-
#   tibble(x = seq(-5, +5, length.out = 100))
# my version
df_q1 <-
  tibble(x = seq(-5, +5, length.out = 100)) %>% 
  mutate(d = dunif(x, min = -1, max = 1))
```

Use the following test to check your answer.

```{r q1-tests}
## NOTE: No need to change this
assertthat::assert_that(
  all(
    df_q1 %>%
      filter(-1 <= x, x <= +1) %>%
      mutate(flag = d > 0) %>%
      pull(flag)
    )
)
assertthat::assert_that(
  all(
    df_q1 %>%
      filter((x < -1) | (+1 < x)) %>%
      mutate(flag = d == 0) %>%
      pull(flag)
    )
)
print("Nice!")
```

## Drawing Samples: A Model for Randomness
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

What does it *practically* mean for a value to be more or less likely? A distribution gives information about a *random variable*. A random variable is a quantity that takes a random value every time we observe it. For instance: If we roll a six-sided die, it will (unpredictably) land on values `1` through `6`. In my research, I use random variables to model material properties: Every component that comes off an assembly line will have a different strength associated with it. In order to design for a desired rate of failure, I model this variability with a random variable. A single value from a random variable---a roll of the die or a single value of material strength---is called a *realization*.

Let's illustrate this idea by using a normal distribution to define a *random variable* `Z`. This is sometimes denoted `Z ~ norm(mean, sd)`, which means `Z` is distributed as a normal distribution with `mean` and `sd`. The code below illustrates what it looks like when we draw a few samples of `Z`.

```{r ex-samples}
## NOTE: No need to change this!
df_norm_samp <- tibble(Z = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1))

ggplot() +
  ## Plot a *sample*
  geom_histogram(
    data = df_norm_samp,
    mapping = aes(Z, after_stat(density)),
    bins = 20
  ) +
  ## Plot a *distribution*
  geom_line(
    data = df_norm_dist,
    mapping = aes(z, d)
  )
```

Note that the histogram of `Z` values looks like a "blocky" version of the density. If we draw many more samples, the histogram will start to strongly resemble the distribution from which it was drawn:

```{r ex-more-samples}
## NOTE: No need to change this!
ggplot() +
  ## Plot a *sample*
  geom_histogram(
    data = tibble(Z = rnorm(n = 1e5, mean = 0, sd = 1)),
    mapping = aes(Z, after_stat(density)),
    bins = 40
  ) +
  ## Plot a *distribution*
  geom_line(
    data = df_norm_dist,
    mapping = aes(z, d)
  )
```

To clarify some terms:

- A **realization** is a single observed value of a random variable. A realization is a single value, e.g. `rnorm(n = 1)`.
- A **sample** is a set of realizations. A sample is a set of values, e.g. `rnorm(n = 10)`.
- A **distribution** is a function that describes the relative frequency of all the values a random variable might take. A distribution is a function, e.g. `dnorm(x)`.

__q2__ Plot densities for `Z` values in `df_q2`. Use aesthetics to plot a separate curve for different values of `n`. Comment on which values of `n` give a density closer to "normal".

*Hint*: You may need to use the `group` aesthetic, in addition to `color` or `fill`.

```{r q2-task}
## NOTE: Use the data generated here
df_q2 <- map_dfr(
  c(5, 10, 1e3),
  function(nsamp) {
    tibble(Z = rnorm(n = nsamp), n = nsamp)
  }
)
## TODO: Create the figure
df_q2 %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x = Z, group = n, color = n))
```

**Observations**
- It looks like a normal distribution, but where higher values of `n` are closer to being normal.

## Random Seeds: Setting the State
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Remember that random variables are *random*. That means if we draw samples multiple times, we're bound to get different values. For example, run the following code chunk multiple times.

```{r ex-multiple-run}
## NOTE: No need to change; run this multiple times!
rnorm(5)
```

What this means is we'll get a slightly different picture every time we draw a sample. **This is the challenge with randomness**: Since we could have drawn a different set of samples, we need to know the degree to which we can trust conclusions drawn from data. Being *statistically literate* means knowing how much to trust your data.

```{r ex-multiple-vis}
## NOTE: No need to change this!
df_samp_multi <-
  tibble(Z = rnorm(n = 50, mean = 0, sd = 1), Run = "A") %>%
  bind_rows(
    tibble(Z = rnorm(n = 50, mean = 0, sd = 1), Run = "B")
  ) %>%
  bind_rows(
    tibble(Z = rnorm(n = 50, mean = 0, sd = 1), Run = "C")
  )

ggplot() +
  ## Plot *fitted distributions*
  geom_density(
    data = df_samp_multi,
    mapping = aes(Z, color = Run, group = Run)
  ) +
  ## Plot a *distribution*
  geom_line(
    data = df_norm_dist,
    mapping = aes(z, d)
  )
```

*However* for simulation purposes, we often want to be able to repeat a calculation. In order to do this, we can set the *state* of our random number generator by setting the *seed*. To illustrate, try running the following chunk multiple times.

```{r ex-seed-run}
## NOTE: No need to change; run this multiple times!
set.seed(101)
rnorm(5)
```

The values are identical every time!
